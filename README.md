## **Introduction**

Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, banks have losses, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. In this Dataset, we look at various attributes such as credit score, mortgage, annual income, years of employment and try to train our classifier to predict if the loan would be paid or not.

## **Data Description**

The dataset contains of 100514  observations and 19 features.The following table explains the dataset:
|Column name| Column type|
